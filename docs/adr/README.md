# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Telegram Bot project.

## What are ADRs?

ADRs document important architectural decisions made during the project. Each ADR explains:
- **Context**: Why the decision is needed
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Consequences**: Pros, cons, and trade-offs
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were evaluated
